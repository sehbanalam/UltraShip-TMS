# 🚀 UltraShip Employee Manager – Full Stack GraphQL App

A modern, full stack employee management platform built with **React + Chakra UI (frontend)** and **Node.js + GraphQL + MongoDB (backend)**.

Built for performance, modularity, and beautiful UX, this app demonstrates scalable GraphQL API design, real-time UI updates, role-based access, and elegant view switching (grid/tile/detail modals).
